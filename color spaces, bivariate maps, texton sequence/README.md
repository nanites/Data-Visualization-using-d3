Question 2: In this, it looks like the legend is showing a dark pink color but we don't see that color in the image. I guess the reason is that the maximum pressure we plot is 203 and not 500


Question 3: In this question, I have not created a matrix. My though process behind this is, Create a color label using hsl. I used pressure points to plot hue, and then used saturation and luminosity to represent pressure and temperature. I did the same thing with the legend associating the legend fill with the same scale therefore my guess is this is how it should work. I may be wrong but giving it a try.
